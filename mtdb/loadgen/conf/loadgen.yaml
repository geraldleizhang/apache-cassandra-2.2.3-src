# Global options
global:
	simulated_time_in_year: 5

	# Simulation time. You can specify a fraction of minutes, e.g., 0.5.

	# Total number of writes
	writes: 10

	# Write time distribution
	# - Uniform distribution with the same inter-arrival intervals.
	# - Random distribution with a uniform distribution probability.

# Per-object options

	# Average number of reads per object, e.g., 1000
	avg_reads: 1000

	# Distribution of the number of reads per object
	# - Uniform: Uniform between min and max
	# - Custom: Use a file that has the number of reads per object distribution
	#           in CDF. E.g., Huang ’14, Figure 5. number of requests per each
	#           object

	# read time distribution
	# - Custom: Use a file that has a read time distribution by age in CDF.
	#           E.g., Kumar. Efficiency at Scale. ’14.
